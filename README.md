## Autononomous Rover Imaging and PID Controller Modules

See the documentation for this project on my LinkedIn Page www.linkedin.com/in/salvatore-pernice - Autonomous System Engineering (ASE) Bachelor Project on my projects section. A live DEMO of the rover's camera POV using dynamic lookahead control can be found in the imaging module directory. Also, you can find the birds-eye-view of the DEMO on my LinkedIn Page as github does not support large files. The Birds eye view is linked to the the second part of this project which is my lane centering accuracy metric developed using a self made local position system by utilizing ArUco Markers placed on top of the rover and a camera to detect them.
